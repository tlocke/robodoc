      Monitoring UK government websites for their use of open and proprietary
      document formats.
    </p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      In 2014 the UK government
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-document-formats-selected-to-meet-user-needs">announced</a> that open standards would be used for
      sharing government documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, PDF or HTML formats are to be used for viewing government
      documents and the Open Document Format (ODF) is to be used for editable
      documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, not all files on UK government websites are published in
      an open format yet, some are still published in a proprietary format. The
      RoboDoc project focuses on editable documents that should be in the open
      format called ODF. It aims to crawl the UK government websites and make a
      list of editable documents and record whether they are in an open or
      proprietary format. Files in the ODF format end in <code>odt</code>,
      <code>ods</code> or <code>odp</code>. Files in a proprietary format
      commonly end in <code>doc</code>, <code>docx</code>, <code>xls</code> and
      <code>xlsx</code>.
    </p>


    <h2>Results of crawls</h2>

    <p>
      Here are the results of the latest runs of the RoboDoc crawler:

      </dt>
      <dd>
        The run was performed on 40,000 pages of
        <a href="http://www.gov.uk/">http://www.gov.uk/</a>. It found 332
        editable documents, only 14% of which are in an open format. Breaking
        it down by year of publication gives the following:
        <table>
          <thead> 
            <tr>
              <th>2012</th>
              <th>2013</th>
              <th>2014</th>
              <th>2015</th>
              <th>2016</th>
              <th>2017</th>
              <th>2018</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>2%</td>
              <td>10%</td>
              <td>12%</td>
              <td>28%</td>
              <td>12%</td>

      <dd>
        The run was performed on 20,000 pages of
        <a href="http://www.gov.uk/">http://www.gov.uk/</a>. It lists 2342
        files on the site that end in either <code>.xls</code>,
        <code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code>. The titles
        of the CSV are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>document_url</code>: The URL of the offending document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>file_extension</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>link_url</code>: The page that the link to the document is on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>crawl_timestamp</code>: The point in time when the document
            was found.

        The run was performed on 10,000 pages of
        <a href="http://www.gov.uk/">http://www.gov.uk/</a>. It lists all files
        on the site that end in either <code>.xls</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>,
        <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code>. The titles of the CSV are:
        <ul>

    <h2>Why Open Standards?</h2>

    <p>
      If a document is written in an open format, anyone can freely write
      editing and viewing software for the format. This means that users aren't
      beholden to a single vendor of software. In contrast, if a document is
      written in a proprietary format, then the user can be locked-in to using
      software from a single vendor.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, web pages are written in the open format HTML, which means
      there's a good choice of web browser (eg. Microsoft Internet Explorer,
      Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or Google Chrome).
    </p>

    <p>
      A WikiBook on open standards has been written which includes a section on
      the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FOSS_Open_Standards/Importance_and_Benefits_of_Open_Standards">benefits of open standards</a>.
