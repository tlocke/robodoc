      Finding where proprietary file formats are used on UK government
      websites.
    </p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      In 2014 the UK government
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-document-formats-selected-to-meet-user-needs">announced</a> that open standards would be used for
      sharing government documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, PDF or HTML formats are to be used for viewing government
      documents and the Open Document Format (ODF) is to be used for sharing or
      collaborating on government documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, not all files on UK government websites are published in
      an open format yet, some are still published in a proprietary format. The
      RoboDoc project aims to crawl the UK government websites and make a list
      of documents that are still published in a proprietary format.
    </p>


    <h2>List Of Proprietary Files</h2>

    <p>
      Here is the CSV of the first run of the RoboDoc crawler:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tlocke/rd_downloads/downloads/problems_2018-02-19.csv">problems_2018-02-19.csv</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The run was performed on 10,000 pages of
      <a href="http://www.gov.uk/">http://www.gov.uk/</a>. It lists all files
      on the site that end in either <code>.xls</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>,
      <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code>. The titles of the CSV are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>document_url</code>: The URL of the document in a proprietary
        format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>file_extension</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>link_url</code>: The page that the link to the document is on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>crawl_timestamp</code>: The point in time when the document was
        found.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

    <h2>Why Open Standards?</h2>

    <p>
      If a document is written in an open format, anyone can freely write
      editing and viewing software for the format. This means that users aren't
      beholden to a single vendor of software. In contrast, if a document is
      written in a proprietary format, then the user can be locked-in to using
      software from a single vendor.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, web pages are written in the open format HTML, which means
      there's a good choice of web browser (eg. Microsoft Internet Explorer,
      Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or Google Chrome).
    </p>

    <p>
      A WikiBook on open standards has been written which includes a section on
      the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FOSS_Open_Standards/Importance_and_Benefits_of_Open_Standards">benefits of open standards</a>.
