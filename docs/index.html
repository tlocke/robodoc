      Monitoring UK government websites for their use of open and proprietary
      document formats.
    </p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      In 2014 the UK government
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-document-formats-selected-to-meet-user-needs">announced</a> that open standards would be used for
      sharing government documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, not all files on UK government websites are published in
      an open format yet, some are still published in a proprietary format. The
      RoboDoc project focuses on editable documents that should be in the open
      format called ODF. It aims to crawl the UK government websites and make a
      list of editable documents and record whether they are in an open or
      proprietary format. Files in the ODF format end in <code>odt</code>,
      <code>ods</code> or <code>odp</code>. Files in a proprietary format
      commonly end in <code>doc</code>, <code>docx</code>, <code>xls</code> and
      <code>xlsx</code>.

          I did another run on 17th March, and the result are available for
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tlocke/rd_downloads/downloads/results_2018-02-27.ods">download</a>.
          This time it looked at 80,000 pages and it showed that 21% of
          documents are in an open format. Here's a graph of the results broken
          down by year of publication:

          The latest run of the RoboDoc crawler tells us that of the documents
          published in 2018, only 12% were in an open format. Now that we've
          got some reasonable data, the next question is how to use it to
          increase that percentage. I

          @OpenForumEurope only 14% of editable docs on http://www.gov.uk  are
          in an open format https://tlocke.github.io/robodoc/  not sure where
          to go from here<br><br><br>

          Cool project ! We did something a while ago at EU level
          http://fixmydocuments.eu/ the figures we found were even lower than
          yours in the UK.<br><br><br>

          Also unsure what can be done to improve. We tried a bit of name &amp;
          shame + contacting the relevant services but there's just so many
          documents out there. Unfortunately I think this is seen as a very low
          priority.

        <p>
          So, I've decided to pick a document that was published in a
          proprietary in 2018:
          <code>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686899/Country_returns_guide_-_March_2018.xls</code>
          and contact the government about that single document. On
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-returns-guide">the page</a>
          that links to this document, there's a link called 'Is there anything
          wrong with this page?'. Clicking on the link reveals a form with two
          fields. Here's what I submitted:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <h5>What were you doing?</h5>
         
          Clicking on the link 
          https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-returns-guide on
          the page
          https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-returns-guide.
          <br>

          <h5>What went wrong</h5>
         
          The spreadsheet is in a proprietary format, but as I understand it,
          government policy is to publish spreadsheets in the open format
          ODF:<br><br>

    <h2>Why Open Standards?</h2>

    <p>
      If a document is written in an open format, anyone can freely write
      editing and viewing software for the format. This means that users aren't
      beholden to a single vendor of software. In contrast, if a document is
      written in a proprietary format, then the user can be locked-in to using
      software from a single vendor.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, web pages are written in the open format HTML, which means
      there's a good choice of web browser (eg. Microsoft Internet Explorer,
      Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or Google Chrome).
    </p>

    <p>
      A WikiBook on open standards has been written which includes a section on
      the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FOSS_Open_Standards/Importance_and_Benefits_of_Open_Standards">benefits of open standards</a>.
